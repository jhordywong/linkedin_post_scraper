It's when we're more likely to take action toward a goal after a special event or date has passed. Examples include New Year's Day, the first day of the month, or even a Monday. These can act as mental triggers for us to start something new. \ud83d\udc49 I learned about a strategy to create even more chances for fresh starts - dividing the day into smaller segments like \ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4, \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb, \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4.
