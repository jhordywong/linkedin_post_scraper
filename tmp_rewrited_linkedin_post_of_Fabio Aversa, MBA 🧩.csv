**I want to share something astounding with you!** 

Just last week, we reached a global population of 8 billion people. 

When I was growing up, many talked about the frightening concept of endless population growth. 

But interestingly, projections show we're not headed towards an infinite increase. 

The predictions say we will likely peak around 10.4 billion people in the year 2086, and after that, we'll see a decline. 

I want you to understand how fast our global family has grown: 

In 1805, we first hit a billion folks around the globe. 

It took us another lengthy period of 120 years to double that number. 

But as time passed, the pace picked up. The jump from two to three billion? It took just 35 years. 

Getting from three to four billion was even quicker, requiring only 14 years. 

The rapid expansion was most pronounced between 1974 and 2011. 

During this time, every increase of one billion people took merely 12 to 13 years for the 5th, 6th, and 7th billion.

Hi there. 

So, I've got a thing for Lean principles, system setups, even playbooks. 

Efficiency? It's kind of my jam. 

But then, something made me stop and think. 

Did I perhaps misunderstand the main idea? 

Here's a bold thought: **If we desire something to last, we should aim for beauty, not just efficiency.** 

I have a hunch this concept reaches beyond just architecture and city planning. 

It's an invite for me to ponder - How can I bring a touch of beauty into my work? 

And also into other parts of life. 

Thanks for joining me in this exploration.

Hey! 

So, I'm into this stuff called Lean, systems, playbooks - you know, making things work smooth and easy. 😎 

But then - boom - something made me stop and think. 🤔

Did I miss the whole point? 

Check this out: **If we want something to last, we should go for beauty, not just get it done fast.** 

I think this idea doesn't stop at designing buildings or planning cities. 🏙️

It's kinda like a challenge for me to think about - How can I make my work not just fast, but also cool and beautiful? 

And not just in work, but in life too. 🌈

Keep rockin'!

Greetings, 

I have a penchant for Lean methodology, systematized operations, and playbooks. 

Efficiency is a key goal. 

However, a recent revelation made me pause. 

Have I misunderstood the foundational premise? 

Consider this: **To create something durable, beauty should be the objective, not merely efficiency.** 

I hypothesize that this principle extends beyond architecture and urban planning. 

It prompts introspection on how I can incorporate aesthetic appeal into my professional endeavors. 

As well as in other facets of existence. 

To continued growth and success.

Hello there!

I wanted to share something interesting with you. Did you know we're living in a 𝗩𝗨𝗖𝗔 world? 

It stands for 𝗩olatility, 𝗨ncertainty, 𝗖omplexity and 𝗔mbiguity. These four elements make it hard for us to grasp what's happening now and predict what might happen next.

Because of this, Change Management has become a vital part of how companies, departments and individuals navigate this VUCA world.

One framework that's really helped me understand this better is the Knoster model. Each ""ingredient"" of the model contributes to the ""recipe"" for managing change.

It's a fascinating concept, don't you think?🧩

Hey guys! 😊

Guess what? We live in a crazy 𝗩𝗨𝗖𝗔 world! 🌍 

That's short for 𝗩olatility, 𝗨ncertainty, 𝗖omplexity and 𝗔mbiguity. These words might seem big, but they simply mean things change fast, it's hard to be sure about stuff, things can get pretty complicated, and it's often unclear what's going on. 🤔

So, how do we handle this? That's where Change Management comes in. It's like a game plan for businesses, teams, and even us, to tackle this VUCA world.

I've been learning about this thing called the Knoster model. It's like a recipe, and each part of it helps us understand how to manage change better. 

Pretty cool, huh? 🧩

Good day, Entrepreneurs,

I'd like to bring your attention to the concept of a 𝗩𝗨𝗖𝗔 world. 

This acronym stands for 𝗩olatility, 𝗨ncertainty, 𝗖omplexity, and 𝗔mbiguity, factors that can hinder our understanding of the present and future.

Consequently, Change Management is essential. As entrepreneurs, it is in this area we face and conquer the VUCA challenges.

I've found the Knoster model incredibly insightful. It breaks down Change Management into components, each an ""ingredient"" contributing to the overall ""recipe.""

Valuable perspective, isn't it? 🧩
