TRUE,"Have you ever heard of the fresh start effect? It's when we're more likely to take action toward a goal after a special event or date has passed. Examples include New Year's Day, the first day of the month, or even a Monday.

Another thing that’s been a game-changer for me is automating the small stuff. 🤖 It frees up my time so I can focus on the important things. 

Being super clear about what I need from each role has been huge. 🎯 *It helps me find the perfect fit every time.*

And guys, let me tell you, putting myself in the decision-making seat often and seeking feedback has been crucial. 

I'm not afraid to try new things and see how they work. 🧪 And always, I mean always, I check the results. 

*Believe me, data doesn't lie.* 

Then, I do it all over again. So, keep at it, and see your hiring game level up! 🧩

And to help us do that, we use a variety of tools and techniques to assess each aspect.🧠 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗱 (𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀), we rely on a behavioural survey and a 1:1 phone screen to get a sense of how a candidate's brain naturally responds to the world.❤️ 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁 (𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀), we use the phone screen and panel interview to gauge a candidate's alignment with our team's culture and vision.💼 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗳𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 (𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀), we turn to the panel interview and past samples of relevant work to assess a candidate's technical skills and expertise.It's important to note that none of these tools is perfect, and they should be considered holistically as part of the evaluation process.

TRUE,"One of the best things I did to improve my hiring process was to reduce the phone interview duration by half 💡In order to generate remarkable results in my hiring approach, I've made some minor but impactful adjustments. 1️⃣ Firstly, I've significantly shortened phone interviews from a half hour to just 15 minutes. This saves the interviewer (me) and the candidate time and ensures that the conversation stays focused on the most critical information.2️⃣ Furthermore, before beginning any interviews, I've taken the time to identify a specific behavioural profile I'm looking for in a candidate based on the job description (e.g. Predictive Index)This helps me understand what qualities will be most valuable for the role and allows me to choose in advance a set of behavioural questions that will be most informative. This saves time and also helps to reduce bias.3️⃣ Another change I made was creating email templates for the most common messages I sent during the hiring process (e.g. Beeftext)This saves me a lot of time, increases efficiency and definitely improves my own overall experience.4️⃣ Lastly, I've automated the scheduling process of coffee chats, phone interviews, panel interviews, and reference checking (e.g. Calendly).This streamlines the hiring process, makes it much easier for everyone involved and allows me to focus on the most crucial part: evaluating the candidates themselves.👉 I've saved time, reduced bias, and improved the candidate experience by making these adjustments to my hiring process.

3️⃣ **I also set up email templates** for the messages I find myself sending most often during the hiring process (like Beeftext). This has saved me heaps of time, made me more efficient, and improved my overall experience. 

4️⃣ **Finally, I made the scheduling process automatic** for things like coffee chats, phone interviews, panel discussions, and reference checks (using tools like Calendly). It makes hiring smoother and easier for everyone, and lets me concentrate on the most important thing: assessing the candidates. 

These changes have allowed me to save time, be more fair, and make the experience better for those applying. If you're looking to boost your hiring process, why not try these strategies? 🧩

Hey, guys! 💁‍♂️ One cool thing I did that really helped my hiring game was to chop the phone interview time in half.💡

It totally transformed how I hire people. Here's what I did:

1️⃣ **First off, I cut the phone interviews short**. Instead of half an hour, they're now just 15 minutes. It's a win-win for me and the person I'm interviewing – we save time and keep our chats all about the key stuff. 

2️⃣ **Then, I worked out what kind of person I want for each job**. Before I even start interviews, I use the job description to decide what traits I'm looking for (kind of like a Predictive Index). This helps me focus on what matters most for the role and plan the best questions. It's quicker and fairer. 👍

3️⃣ **I also started using email templates** for the messages I send out most during hiring (thanks to Beeftext). It saves me so much time, makes me super efficient, and definitely makes my life easier.

4️⃣ **And lastly, I automated the scheduling process** for stuff like coffee catch-ups, phone interviews, group interviews, and checking references (using Calendly). It makes the whole hiring thing smoother and lets me focus on the really important bit – getting to know the candidates.

By making these changes, I've saved time, been more fair, and made the whole experience better for applicants. If you're looking to level up your hiring, why not give these tips a try? 🧩

Hello friends! 

Let's talk about something interesting. 

**OpenAI's 𝗚𝗣𝗧-𝟯** has really been making headlines. 

Why? 

Because it creates text that feels like it's written by a person. 

But now, there's something even more amazing on the horizon - **𝗚𝗣𝗧-𝟰**. 

You won't believe it but it's much bigger than GPT-3! 

Do you remember how big GPT-3 was? 

It was trained with 175 billion parameters. 

Now, guess how many parameters GPT-4 has. 

You won't believe it - it's 100 trillion! 😲 

Let's try to understand these big numbers. 

175 billion seconds is like 5,500 years. 

That's from the time the Pyramids were built till today. 

Now, 100 trillion seconds is 3,170,979 years! 

That's a very long time - about **630 times longer** than since the Pyramids were built! 

So what does this mean for GPT-4? 

It means it can do a better job at making text and understanding different languages. 

It can remember more details and pick up on the small things in language. 

But here's the thing, 

Right now, GPT-4 isn't available for everyone. 

It's only being used by a special group of people who study and make new technology. 

Well, that's all for now, folks! 

Remember to keep learning and asking questions. 🧩

It's crazy good at writing stuff that sounds just like a human. 🙌 

Guess what? 

There's a new version coming up - **𝗚𝗣𝗧-𝟰**! 

And it's gonna be huge, way bigger than GPT-3! 😲 

Just to remind you, 

GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters. 

But GPT-4? 

It's estimated to have a whopping 100 trillion parameters! 🤯 

To understand these crazy big numbers, 

Think of it this way: 

175 billion seconds is like 5,500 years. 

That's from when the Pyramids were built till today. 

And 100 trillion seconds? 

That's 3,170,979 years, or **630 times longer** than from when the Pyramids were built! 🕰️ 

So what does this mean for GPT-4? 

It's gonna be better at creating text and translating languages. 

It'll remember more stuff and get the tiny details in language. 

But heads up, 

GPT-4 isn't available to everyone just yet. 

Right now, only a special group of techies and smarty-pants are using it. 🧠

TRUE,"Correction: In a previous version of this post, I incorrectly stated that the terms 'bull' and 'bear' in relation to the stock market originated from the movements of the animals themselves (i.e. bulls attack by swiping up, bears by swiping down). This is not the case. The terms originated from a proverb warning against selling the bear's skin before you have caught it. The term 'bear' was first used in the 18th century to refer to speculators selling stock they didn't own, expecting prices to drop. This practice was prevalent in the South Sea bubble scandal of 1720, which brought the term into widespread use.

Hello there! I wanted to correct something I shared in a past post. I had mentioned that the terms 'bull' and 'bear', used in the context of the stock market, came from the behaviors of these animals. Well, turns out that's not quite right. 

In reality, these words come from an old saying. It was about not selling a bear's skin before actually catching the bear. 

In the 1700s, 'bear' became a nickname for people who would sell stocks they didn't own yet. They were hoping the prices would go down. 

This happened a lot during a time called the South Sea bubble scandal in 1720. After this event, more people started using the term 'bear'. 

Later on, the term 'bull' was used for people who bought stocks or other items because they thought the prices would go up. So now you know a little more about the stock market. 🧩

I need to correct an earlier post. 

I previously stated the terms 'bull' and 'bear' originated from animal behavior. This is incorrect. 

These terms come from an old proverb, warning against prematurely selling a bear's skin. 

The label 'bear' was first used in the 18th century. It referred to speculators who sold stocks they did not own, anticipating a price fall. 

This term gained traction during the South Sea bubble scandal of 1720. 

'Bull' was later used for those purchasing securities, expecting prices to rise.

Ever noticed how people who talk a lot often become leaders? 

That's what this ""Babble Effect"" is all about.

It's not a question of right or wrong, it's just that data shows us that talkative people often get rewarded.

Hello there,

Allow me to share an enriching experience I had during a career-related conversation with a team member recently. We delved into the prospect of discovering new ventures and disciplines.

Having put forth my insights, I relied on my analytical capabilities to evaluate their choices. However, a famous quote by Sigmund Freud came to my mind: ""**In small matters trust the mind, in large ones the heart.**""

If you feel a strong, instinctual pull towards a new opportunity, I encourage you to seize it, even if it may not seem like the optimal decision logically. It is this energy, this passion, that propels us towards delivering our best.

So I say, welcome it. Let it be the driving force behind your future endeavors.

To my fellow entrepreneurs,

I wish to share a professional discourse I had with one of my team members not long ago. We discussed navigating unfamiliar territories and industries.

Upon providing my viewpoints, I leveraged my analytical expertise to help assess their potential paths. Then, a pertinent quote by Sigmund Freud resurfaced: ""**In matters of less importance, trust the intellect; in significant ones, trust the heart.**""

If an unconventional opportunity resonates with your instinct, embrace it, despite it not appearing as the most rational choice. It's this very passion that fuels our finest work.

**We had some big moments!** 

Do you know how many people live on Earth? We hit **8 billion**! That's a lot of friends! 

And guess what? Our whole world made over **$100 trillion**. Wow, that's a big number! 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that our economy is worth **$101.6 trillion**. 

The **United States** made **one quarter of that**. 

**China** and **Japan** are next in line. 

**Canada** is eighth and **Italy** is tenth. 

But, these numbers don't tell us everything. 

They don't think about how many people live in a country. This is called GDP per Capita. 

When we think about this, **Europe** is the best. 

Countries like **Luxembourg**, **Ireland**, and **Norway** are doing great! 

The **United States** falls to seventh, **Canada** to eleventh, and **Italy** to thirty-first. 

Also, they don't tell us about the strength of a country's money. 

This is about what you can buy for $1. 

In this case, **China** is first, followed by the **United States** and **India**. 

**Italy** and **Canada** are a bit behind in twelfth and fifteenth place.

Hi there, friends!

👋 

New year's resolutions used to be my thing, but I took a break from them. 

🤔 

Still, this special list had me rethinking their importance.

📝 

Firstly, the mind of an entrepreneur is an interesting thing.

💼 

It's all about owning up to everything that happens, saying yes more often than no, and thinking of solutions instead of problems. 

💡 

It's also about valuing action more than just ideas, and never stopping to learn. 

🎓 

Secondly, an athlete's body is another resolution.

🏋️‍♀️ 

It involves eating well and exercising daily. 

🥦 

Also, it's about getting plenty of sleep, stretching, meditating, fasting, and experiencing cold exposure. 

😴 

Lastly, having an artist's soul is worth considering.

🎨 

It's about embracing life, finding creative outlets, trusting your gut feelings, and being true to yourself. 

❤️ 

Do you have a different take on these? I'm curious to know!

Hey there! 👋

Did you know I used to make New Year's resolutions, but then I kinda stopped. 🛑 

But guess what? This cool list got me thinking again. 🤔

Think about what having an entrepreneur's mind might mean. 🧠💼

It's about dealing with whatever happens, thinking 'maybe' and 'and' instead of 'no' and 'either/or'. It's putting doing over just planning. And never stop learning! 📚

Now, what about having an athlete's body? 🏃‍♀️

That's about eating right, daily exercise, early bedtime for a solid 8 hours sleep, stretching, and meditation. Don't forget fasting and cold exposure too! ❄️

And then, there's the artist's soul. 🎨

It's about being open to new things, finding ways to be creative, trusting your own feelings, even if you can't explain them, and just being you. 👌

What's your take on all this? 🧐

Greetings, Entrepreneurs! 👋

I have contemplated New Year's resolutions in the past but paused. Recently, a compelling list sparked fresh thoughts. 📜

Consider the entrepreneur's mindset. 💼

It involves embracing accountability, viewing circumstances with openness and flexibility, prioritizing implementation over mere strategies, and continuously learning. 📚

Next, the athlete's body. 🏃‍♂️

It necessitates nutritious eating, daily exercise, sufficient sleep, stretching, meditation, fasting, and even cold exposure. 🥗

Lastly, the artist's soul. 🎨

It calls for openness to experiences, fostering creativity, trusting your instincts, and remaining authentic. 🌟

What do these signify to you?

TRUE,"The 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 is a phenomenon that occurs when people are more likely to take action towards a goal after a special occasion or key date has passed.

Hello there, I'd like to share something I came up with a bit ago - **a handy calendar template**. It was a tool I created for myself to help with vacation planning and for a clear view of the work weeks. The feature I appreciate the most about it is its ability to **display all 365 days on a single screen**. This makes planning your precious time off so much simpler!

You might know this about me, I'm quite fond of information that's **easy to digest in one look**. The template I'm sharing already has the majority of the Canadian holidays pre-filled, however, you are free to **alter it to suit your specific needs**. Whether it's adding or removing holidays based on your organization or your country, it's all up to you!

I've found it quite helpful in my own use, and I hope it can be of some assistance to you as well. Here's the link to download it: **bit.ly/3i6AgE6**. Wishing you an amazing 2023!

Life is more like 𝗣𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿 than Chess (chess is computation, while real-life also consists of luck and occasional deception)2. All decisions are bets, and we should think in 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 terms (i.e. likelihood), not absolutist terms (i.e. true/false)3. 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗮𝘀 (aka Resulting) is our tendency to believe that a good outcome signifies a good decision. And a bad result is a sign of a wrong decision4. Instead, good decisions can generate adverse outcomes at times, and 𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲-𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮5. The goal is to improve the quality of decision-making because, over time, it will generate a higher 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗱 of success6.

I want to share some valuable learnings from Annie Duke’s splendid book, Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts.

Here's an interesting thought.
**Life is more like Poker than Chess.**
While chess is about calculation, real-life brings in luck and occasional deception too.

Next, a neat observation. 
**All decisions are bets**.
We should think more in terms of 'chances' rather than 'right or wrong'.

Another takeaway is about **Outcome Bias**. 
Sometimes we think that a good outcome means a good decision and a bad outcome points to a wrong decision.

But truth is, good decisions can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. And it can happen the other way around too.

The aim should always be to improve our decision-making skills. 
Why? 
Because, over time, this will increase the **chances of success**.

Here's a useful tip.
Create a system that welcomes different viewpoints instead of shutting them down.

Also, remember our feelings about outcomes depend on the **path we've taken**. For example, how would you feel if you win $1000 at a casino and then lose them, compared to if you lose $1000 and then win them back?

Ever heard of the **10-10-10 rule**? 
Ask yourself how you'd feel about a decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.

Try **Backcasting**. 
This is all about working backwards from a positive future instead of making predictions based on past data.

Lastly, host a **Premortem**. 
Imagine we didn't achieve our goals. What went wrong? How can we prevent it?

I highly recommend this book! 🧩

Once the project was on the SteerCo shortlist, the BVS didn’t matter much anymore, other than providing more context around costs and effort estimation if required.

FALSE,"How to prioritize your company’s SaaS projects - 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 3.0 𝐆𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞👇Sizing the projects and ranking them was an essential step in our selection process, but not the final one. In my experience, the Business teams might not be aware of each other's initiatives, and the team managing the project funnel might be the only one with a holistic view of what’s happening in the organization. So, we had to raise awareness by bringing this holistic view back to the different business groups, especially when discussing the most transformational initiatives. For the organization to make an informed decision, it was essential that we established the proper forums and communicated a lot of information quickly and effectively. Governance is the most critical of the steps and the most difficult to get right.

It does make sense to prioritize the projects with the most robust business case. ⚠️ In my experience, though, there is one crucial caveat:Building a business case that includes ROI and IRR calculations takes time, skills and effort. And the problem with that is not all the business units in the company have strategy managers or performance analysts on staff to build one.

But towards the end of the project, shift focus on the 20% remaining, as it is more motivating than the 80% completed. 👉 Focusing on small areas 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬.🧩Click [+ Follow] for more",,Jun-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6945719896211140610,3,0,,,,,

Hiring a team solely based on attitude won't generally allow you to deliver results fast enough. It would help if you had people who - in addition to the right attitude - have also been in the trenches, can hit the ground running, and teach the ropes to the rest of the team. On the other side, hiring solely based on skill will likely not generate enough innovation in the long term. Your practice could become stale, irrelevant and ineffective over time - unable to see new paradigms and take advantage of new opportunities.

It's not as simple as one person is good, and the other is not.Therefore, providing feedback is tricky.I generally try to offer some feedback and ask the candidates if they are interested in hearing it. I find it's a small way to compensate for their time spent going through the interviews.To do that, I pick 2-3 pieces of relevant feedback I have written down during the debrief with the panel members. And then, I start my sentences with, During the interview, you did not demonstrate...I generally get two reactions:Some candidates are open and genuinely grateful to get some feedback.Others don't want to hear it or challenge it in non-constructive ways.

Until years ago, I made a terribly wrong hire that I could have prevented with a quick phone call. Finally, I've learnt the lesson.During the interview process, you must obtain consent from the applicant to contact their references and ask employment-related questions. That's why we ask for it early in the process, at the beginning of our first phone interview.We don't let candidates choose their references, but we ask them to speak to the people who supervised them. It is good practice to talk to two or three work-related references.Your Talent Acquisition Partner will be able to provide a list of suitable questions, but some examples are:• Please describe your working relationship with the Candidate? (ensure they led the candidate)• How would you best describe the Candidate's ability to handle change and ambiguity?• Would you rehire the Candidate again in the future? 🧩",,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6903326538381488128,2,0,,,,,

This. Is. Important. Don't start the debrief until everyone has provided their recommendation.During the debrief session, every panel member presents their rationale and evaluation on the three main criteria identified in step #4.1: Interpersonal, Culture fit, and Skills.You can use the Candidate Tracking tool from step #2.1 to record the recommendations of each panel member.Ultimately the decision sits with the hiring manager. However, in my experience, the recommendation from the panel is often unanimous, in one direction or the other. Occasionally a panel member has a different opinion from the majority, which we can discuss during the debriefing. If the panel is split between Hire / No Hire, I suggest proceeding with extreme caution. One of the challenges to consider is that panel members will not feel accountable for the success of a colleague they wouldn't have hired in the first place.🧩",,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6902964153036656640,5,0,,,,,

In addition, a standard approach reduces the number of variables and increases the fairness of the whole process.Here's how to go about it:✅ Introduce the panel to the candidate. Briefly introduce the members of the panel and their role in relation to the position (e.g. colleagues, stakeholders, or partners). ✅ Review the steps of the interview process. Please explain what the process looks like, which phase we are in and what comes next. State that the last step will be checking past work references, as already mentioned in the phone interview.✅ Ask the same questions to all candidates.

The meeting will include 60 minutes with the candidate, a 5 minutes break, and 25 minutes debrief for the panel members.A helpful tip is to book two separate but overlapping meetings: 1️⃣ one 60 mins meeting with the candidate 2️⃣ and a 90 mins meeting with the panel membersHere some more details:1️⃣ In the meeting invite for the candidate, I include three items:• Overview of the panel interview format• Link to a helpful article about behavioral questions• Request for samples of past work2️⃣ In the meeting invite for the panel, I include four items:• Candidate resume• Samples of relevant work provided by the candidate• List of 10-12 predefined behavioral questions• A reminder of the interview structure and purposeCheck out the pdf guide in the Featured section of my profile for the meeting invite template.🧩",,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6902239384783925248,3,0,,,,,

They might sound like this:☑️ Right decisions are sometimes unpopular.

You just showed five people a lack of planning skills. • The first question is always “Tell us about yourself”. A good answer gives us a sense of who you are as a person, not only as a professional.

FALSE,"Do you know how much available capacity your team has to take on new projects? Here's how to find out in a few minutes.Understanding and communicating your team capacity/availability is top of mind if you are involved with project delivery. So last year I created this spreadsheet to estimate my team's capacity. While not perfect, it proved pretty helpful in forecasting the ebbs and flows of our bandwidth.My team is moving to an online project management tool, and I thought I'd share the 2022 version of the file for those that might need it.This file is not supposed to be perfectly accurate. Instead, it provides a weekly forecast of available capacity *at a glance*. I prioritized ease of use over accuracy because I think the margin of error in these estimates is pretty high anyway. I'll include a link in the comments if you want to give it a try for your team. To start using the file, you will need to copy the original. Go on to the top left, click File > Make a copyHere's a quick overview of how it works:- Row 1 shows the weekly schedule for the year. The current week automatically shows in yellow, so you can easily identify it. The Q1 weeks are coloured in gray, Q2 in blue etc.- Row 3 shows the average team allocation. It estimates the overall capacity of your team for each given week. It simply calculates the average of all the team members' allocation in the spreadsheet. - Row 5 shows the individual team member allocation based on the different projects they support. For example, there are 15 team members in the file with up to 10 projects each (not shown in the screenshot).- When you enter your team member's name in cell A5, it will automatically populate in the rows below. How I use it:- I ask my team to enter their own estimated allocation at the beginning of each week. They enter the % allocation in the relevant cells for the entire project duration if possible. If not, I ask for a five weeks forecast.- These numbers can change from week to week, so I don't use them as commitments but rather as best guesses. Again, I'm prioritizing timeliness over accuracy.- I briefly review the estimates every one or two weeks during the recurring 1:1s to better understand the status- For example, looking at the forecast in the screenshot, you can tell that this team member will have a peak of work at the end of February and that they will likely be available to support another significant project only as of the week of March 14 (when their estimated time allocation drops to 60%).That's it in a nutshell. I hope it can be helpful. If you have less than 15 direct reports, you'll need to change the formula on Row 3 to calculate the average correctly. Add a comment below if you need some help to do that. If any of you spreadsheet gurus have ideas on improving it or automating it more, please go ahead and share the love.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQFRAiitqf1otw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1641911247064?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=Wqb7ZwOg6gbFPB0RccDR3s4f_4tmxNg-UYZXzrlyTJQ,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6886674942931345410,6,1,,,,,
FALSE,"Have you ever heard of Self-Determination theory? The term self-determination refers to a person's own ability to manage themselves, make confident choices, and think on their own.

I recently had the chance to talk about my team's engagement, and I referred to this theory as one of my guiding principles in managing people since I learned about it several years ago.• AutonomyIt is about leveraging individual talents, avoiding micromanagement and getting out of the way. It also means being tolerant of mistakes and allowing people the time to fix their errors: individuals who are not terrified of making mistakes will accelerate their learning curve. • CompetenceIt is about providing clear guidelines about the expected deliverables and then upskilling for any gaps. A clear path to career progression is also an element of developing competence: this can be achieved by clearly identifying the skills and level of proficiency required to achieve the following role/title.• BelongingIt is about fostering a team culture of business performance and lightheartedness. I've read somewhere that camaraderie results from sharing pain (i.e. hard work and failures) and laughter. I've found that to be true.

The topic would deserve a much longer post, but here's the summary in case it can help those going through it right now:• In a spreadsheet, list all the dimensions you will use to rate performance in the first column. I have identified about 20, and here are some examples: Decision Making. Problem Solving. Communication. Relationships. Quality of Work. Volume of Work.• In the other columns, write the team members' names. Then for each performance dimension, assign a value. I use a 5-point Likert scale, from Very High to Very Low. Although I do have a good sense of each individual's performance, I find this step helps articulate what I already know more precisely.• Next step is to write the review. I generally write a Core Message first, which is the one thing I want the team member to remember. Then I elaborate with more comments following the SEER format (Summarize, Elaborate, Example, Restate), for example, Amy is my best strategy manager. She consistently exceeds every standard. She recently got approval for a project we struggled with for months. She's an example we should put on training videos.• To help me with the exact language, I've used a few books like Phrases for effective performance reviews when drafting the message. Those sentences are great templates that I can refine to communicate what I want to convey more effectively and professionally.Again, this summary barely scratches the surface of this critical and timely topic.

FALSE,"How big can a team become and still be cohesive?Every time a new person joins a team, the complexity in the system grows significantly. That's because the number of relationships amongst team members increases geometrically. Basically, in any group of n people (like your team), the number of possible relationships (R) is [ n x (n-1) / 2 ]. This phenomenon is one of the main reasons it's so tricky to manage tremendous growth.  More people means more communication issues, more outcomes to manage, and more incentives to consider. I've seen it first hand three times in my career when the group I was part of grew rapidly. And in my experience, it's easy to underestimate the rate at which complexity increases as the team expands. Outside the business world, think about the birth of a third child. When the family goes from 4 to 5 members, relationships almost double from 6 to 10.  Agile's ideal team size is famously set based on the two-pizza rule, which states that no squad should be so large that two pizzas can't feed the whole group. That's about eight people or 28 relationships.

FALSE,"Have you heard of #NFTs?Gartner (see my post from a couple of days ago) says that companies quickly recognize the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to grow business models and drive new revenue streams. And that by 2026, non-fungible tokens will propel a new entrant into the top 10 highest-valued companies.I've been reading about NFTs recently, and it is a technology that certainly will revolutionize many industries. Yet, I found it difficult to explain it quickly. Then I found this video. Tom Bilyeu explained to Quentin Tarantino how to use non-fungible tokens with his cult movie Pulp Fiction. Watch it to learn what's an NFT in 60 seconds.So NFTs are about:• Ownership: the same way an original Picasso is worth more than a copy. Blockchain technology allows for tracking of the lineage and guarantees originality.• Status: the same way people buy luxury brands like Gucci or Ferrari, to communicate Status. A public wallet of the NFTs owned will allow communicating Status at a distance and to a larger audience.• Belonging: communities develop around artists, fictional characters, games, and more. NFTs will allow people to identify each other and join large or exclusive groups and events. • Value Storage: imagine if the Beatles released 500 NFTs of their debut song's artwork (Love Me Do, 1962), let's say to raise funds amongst their early fans. How much do you think that would be worth today?There are inflated expectations around this technology today. As a result, not all current NFT projects will be successful. As the Internet's dot-com bubble in the 1990s, the vast majority will ultimately fail.

I worked with Intake Briefs, Campaign Flows, Call-to-Actions, Leads, Routing Rules, Preference Centers, and CASL Anti-Spam regulations. Occasionally I also attended lengthy meetings about which critter was more suited to the campaign. Maybe one too many.The most memorable moments include several iPhone launch campaigns preceded by hectic long days. There may or may not have been a situation where a routing rule got accidentally deleted by a well-meaning team member, and I had to call Veneranda at 5 am to save the day. Unfortunately, to this day, we have not been able to identify the culprit.The most rewarding project was successfully migrating our Marketing Automation platform from Eloqua to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It was a 12-months long project that went from evaluating different MA platforms to conducting a multi-dimensional assessment of the three alternatives, from presenting our recommendations to our Director and the management team to managing the project of migrating the platform. I'm sure Bogdan lost a few nights' sleep towards the end.I remember the hard work as we advanced the Marketing Automation practice, achieved industry-leading turn-around times and consistently achieved excellent CSAT scores of >95%.But mostly, I remember the camaraderie, the laughs, and the selfless teamwork.

FALSE,"Hey Linkedin, when was the last time you hired for attitude rather than skills? Was it a success story?“Hire for attitude, train for skills” has become a pretty ubiquitous saying. It sounds great, I like it a lot. And I implement it with moderation. Hiring a team exclusively based on attitude (assuming you can accurately assess it) won’t generally allow you to deliver results fast enough. You need people who have been in the trenches, can hit the ground running and can teach the ropes to the rest of the team. On the other side, hiring exclusively based on skill will likely not generate enough innovation in the long term. Your practice could become stale, irrelevant and ineffective over time - unable to see new paradigms and take advantage of new opportunities. It has been my experience and it is my belief that if you want to build a resilient team, you need to build a diverse bench, with both highly skilled seasoned professionals as well as people with less domain expertise but with lot of potential (i.e. they are a good culture fit, demonstrate a strong work ethic, have a growth-mindset and are coachable). The ideal composition would depend on complexity of the skills to be acquired, on the need for early results, and on team size, among other factors - but I’d say a good rule of thumb for the team ratio is 2/3 skilled professionals and 1/3 people with potential.

FALSE,"Have you heard of the #GreatResignation? Here’s an alternative perspective worth considering. The Great Resignation is the ongoing trend of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs, from spring 2021 to the present, largely in the United States.Here’s the interesting viewpoint: the graph shows the monthly number of people quitting their jobs (provided by the US federal government), since January 2011.What this graph and trend line show, is that the number of people quitting their jobs has been climbing since 2011. The exception to this is when it dropped a large amount in March and April 2020 (COVID). The data is basically right back to where it would be if the earlier trend had just continued (if there had been no pandemic).So a headline such as “Record number of Americans are quitting their jobs” could also be written as “Number of Americans quitting their job each month has steadily increased over the past 10 years”Check out Mark Graban for more on this insightful and though-provoking angle. #HumanResources #Business #Hiring #FutureOfWork",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFlAV5I3BE4WQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1636375504160?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=S7_T4VPPj4r1_Sy6z3aN2bWIMPKVySYrR3P4RYB9RSc,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6863456347166531584,7,6,,,,,

FALSE,"Literally hours after I have published here on LinkedIn my Practical Guide to Effective #Hiring for first-time managers, this very successful serial entrepreneur (GaryVee anyone?) posted the message below, which seems to be in complete contrast to mine - and it got me thinking.I obviously believe in a well-structured hiring process and I think you can remove most of the guess work from recruiting.That said, I know that no hiring process will generate perfect results 100% of the times. You can follow all the right steps, and still make a bad hire (type 1 error). Or miss the opportunity to hire a superstar (type 2 error), because the system screened them out – or maybe because the process took too long and they accepted another offer. So, make a bad hire or miss a superstar: which one of the two is the biggest error?The benefits of a great hire are so disproportionate that missing the opportunity to hire a superstar is likely the worst of the two. As you can never get that back. You can’t really fix that mistake. On the other side, you can fix a bad hire. And the faster you act, the more contained is the damage.

FALSE,"As a not-so-smart boss myself, I wholeheartedly disagree with this entire Inc. Magazine article. The one sentence I do agree with is that the value people bring “are their ideas. Their creativity. Their analysis. Their willingness to take responsibility and embrace accountability”. For the rest, this is terrible advice, particularly for people who are starting in a new role, a new team or a new company. To begin with, verbal communication famously represents less than half of all communication between individuals. So for a remote workforce desperately looking to cooperate and to bridge distances, cutting off the massive value of non-verbal communication seems unwise. Furthermore, I don't agree with the hidden assumption that you need to perform for the camera. Why can't you just be yourself? Many things once taboo while videoconferencing, are now common and acceptable (e.g. kids sneaking behind their on-camera parents). It’s actually been an incredible tool for sharing our own uniqueness and getting closer to each other. Lastly, one of the points of the article is that people “used to look at you less during in-person meetings” compared to how much they look at you now during online meetings. This seems ludicrous. People did look at you all the time during an in person meeting. I consider myself an introvert, and I understand the appeal of being off-camera. Yet a while ago I made the decision that it was important to keep my camera on at all times, for all meetings. I figured that as we lost the opportunity to connect in person, it was important (1) for my team, my peers and my boss to see me on daily basis and (2) for people that didn’t know me yet, to realize I wasn’t just a faceless voice. When someone joins my team, one of the first things I tell them during our first meeting on their first day, is that in order to be successful they will need to build relationships. In fact, it is part of being on the team and one of the reasons I hired them for. It’s literally a paragraph in the recruitment ad. They are expected to develop relationships with our team, partners and stakeholders. And turning on the webcam is the simplest, most powerful step they can take towards that goal. I invite my team members to keep their camera on during their own meetings because I honestly believe that it’ll help their relationships – and careers – in the long term. I do request them to be on camera during our weekly 1:1s and all-team meetings as it helps me read the room, pick up on non-verbal clues and get a sense of whether my message is landing correctly – all things that I can no longer do in person. I do this because any tiny piece of feedback I can get, helps me generate better outcomes for all.  Turning on the camera is the simplest yet most powerful gesture for a remote workforce to build stronger relationships, connect more deeply with each other and be more successful in their role.#RemoteWorkforce #Career #Meetings #Opinions",,May-22,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6858760709694742528,6,0,,,,,
