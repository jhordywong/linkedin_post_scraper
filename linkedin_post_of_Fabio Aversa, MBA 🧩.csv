"Have you ever heard of the fresh start effect? It's when we're more likely to take action toward a goal after a special event or date has passed. Examples include New Year's Day, the first day of the month, or even a Monday. These can act as mental triggers for us to start something new. 👉 I learned about a strategy to create even more chances for fresh starts - dividing the day into smaller segments like 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗼𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴. This way, if you miss an opportunity to do something, you can try again in a few hours. For example, if you have a tough morning, don't let it ruin the whole day - you can start fresh in the afternoon.🧩",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5610AQEnvQac7HBoNg/image-shrink_800/0/1682943603221?e=1684720800&v=beta&t=ef936PfdtaO-WXizENwut7Zdrn_HhxvAklR-6x9CRzA,May-2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7058777132696571904,23,4

"One of the best things I did to improve my hiring process was to reduce the phone interview duration by half 💡In order to generate remarkable results in my hiring approach, I've made some minor but impactful adjustments. 1️⃣ Firstly, I've significantly shortened phone interviews from a half hour to just 15 minutes. This saves the interviewer (me) and the candidate time and ensures that the conversation stays focused on the most critical information.2️⃣ Furthermore, before beginning any interviews, I've taken the time to identify a specific behavioural profile I'm looking for in a candidate based on the job description (e.g. Predictive Index)This helps me understand what qualities will be most valuable for the role and allows me to choose in advance a set of behavioural questions that will be most informative. This saves time and also helps to reduce bias.3️⃣ Another change I made was creating email templates for the most common messages I sent during the hiring process (e.g. Beeftext)This saves me a lot of time, increases efficiency and definitely improves my own overall experience.4️⃣ Lastly, I've automated the scheduling process of coffee chats, phone interviews, panel interviews, and reference checking (e.g. Calendly).This streamlines the hiring process, makes it much easier for everyone involved and allows me to focus on the most crucial part: evaluating the candidates themselves.👉 I've saved time, reduced bias, and improved the candidate experience by making these adjustments to my hiring process.

"Correction: In a previous version of this post, I incorrectly stated that the terms 'bull' and 'bear' in relation to the stock market originated from the movements of the animals themselves (i.e. bulls attack by swiping up, bears by swiping down). This is not the case. The terms originated from a proverb warning against selling the bear's skin before you have caught it. The term 'bear' was first used in the 18th century to refer to speculators selling stock they didn't own, expecting prices to drop. This practice was prevalent in the South Sea bubble scandal of 1720, which brought the term into widespread use. The term 'bull' was later coined to refer to those who bought securities or commodities expecting a price rise.
