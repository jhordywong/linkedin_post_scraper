The term 'bear' was first used in the 18th century to refer to speculators selling stock they didn't own, expecting prices to drop. This practice was prevalent in the South Sea bubble scandal of 1720, which brought the term into widespread use.

If so, consider learning about the DISC personality framework.The DISC framework is often used in business and management settings to improve team members' communication, collaboration, and understanding. It was developed in the 1920s by Harvard psychologist William Moulton Marston. He proposed that there are four primary character types, each characterized by a set of distinct behavioural traits (although individuals will exhibit attributes from multiple traits): \u2022 Dominance (D)\u2022 Influence (I)\u2022 Steadiness (S)\u2022 Conscientiousness (C)The psychology field has evolved tremendously in the past 100 years, and today there are much more accurate behavioural tests (e.g. Big Five).That said, the DISC framework can still be a helpful introduction for those looking to learn more about \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00 and how to interact effectively with others.When I first encountered DISC in 2016, I spent some time compiling all the information I could find on the different traits into \ud835\uddee \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01.\ud83d\udc49 I found it helpful at the time, so \ud835\udddc'\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02.

I couldn\u2019t articulate it very well, so I looked it up. Growing and thriving are similar in that they both refer to the development of new abilities, the expansion of existing ones or some form of progress. However:A growing plant is getting bigger and developing new leaves and branches. Likewise, a \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb is developing new skills and experiences that help them become more capable and knowledgeable.Instead, a thriving plant is not just getting bigger but is also healthy and producing flowers or fruit. Likewise, a \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 is not just developing new skills but is also happy and successful.\ud83d\udc49 In summary, growth refers to progress, expansion and development of new skills. Thriving, on the other hand, implies that something is not just growing but is also healthy and prosperous. As we consider the future of our career, company, or family, it is helpful to ask ourselves whether we are simply growing or if we are truly thriving. \ud83e\udde9", "content_media": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEeXLkHoOpDCg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1670419208722?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=sHzRUEbzBpQynY2Vukg41mculpwOvTkPSXArBGwX3Ng", "date": "December-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7006245996439502849", "number_of_likes": 17, "number_of_comments": 6}, {"content_of_the_post": "We have heard that AI will change everything, but most of us don't have access to any practical tool we could use daily. \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf8.Open AI launched ChatGPT, a game-changing natural language processing tool that generates responses to user inputs.
