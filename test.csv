"This list got me thinking about the meaning of these objectives for me. ⁠⁠An 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗿'𝘀 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱 means taking charge and being responsible for everything that goes down. ⁠⁠It means being open to different perspectives and possibilities, rather than just saying no. ⁠⁠It means prioritizing action over planning and always looking to learn more. ⁠⁠An 𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲'𝘀 𝗯𝗼𝗱𝘆 means eating healthy and working out daily. ⁠⁠It means going to bed early and getting a solid 8 hours of sleep. ⁠⁠It means taking time to relax and clear your mind through stretching and meditation, and even trying out fasting and cold exposure. ⁠⁠An 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁'𝘀 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗹 means being open to new experiences and finding ways to tap into your creativity. ⁠⁠It means trusting your gut, even if you can't put it into words. ⁠⁠It means being authentic.⁠👉 What do they mean to you?⁠🧩",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5610AQGFrfnxcG8duA/image-shrink_800/0/1683548404417?e=1684659600&v=beta&t=i_jPH1N9nTQPiC7RZ6IHHU0IUbZ0RPBGMfQUsPk7rgk,May-2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7061313832127791104,May-2023

"Have you ever heard of the fresh start effect? It's when we're more likely to take action toward a goal after a special event or date has passed. Examples include New Year's Day, the first day of the month, or even a Monday. These can act as mental triggers for us to start something new. 👉 I learned about a strategy to create even more chances for fresh starts - dividing the day into smaller segments like 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗼𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴. This way, if you miss an opportunity to do something, you can try again in a few hours. For example, if you have a tough morning, don't let it ruin the whole day - you can start fresh in the afternoon.🧩",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5610AQEnvQac7HBoNg/image-shrink_800/0/1682943603221?e=1684659600&v=beta&t=b8hTEnRNX-nCWpTg_QnYJh8BXgEk0w9-P-69DFkHZ2k,May-2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7058777132696571904,May-2023
