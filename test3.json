The term 'bear' was first used in the 18th century to refer to speculators selling stock they didn't own, expecting prices to drop. This practice was prevalent in the South Sea bubble scandal of 1720, which brought the term into widespread use.

If so, consider learning about the DISC personality framework.The DISC framework is often used in business and management settings to improve team members' communication, collaboration, and understanding. It was developed in the 1920s by Harvard psychologist William Moulton Marston. He proposed that there are four primary character types, each characterized by a set of distinct behavioural traits (although individuals will exhibit attributes from multiple traits): \u2022 Dominance (D)\u2022 Influence (I)\u2022 Steadiness (S)\u2022 Conscientiousness (C)The psychology field has evolved tremendously in the past 100 years, and today there are much more accurate behavioural tests (e.g. Big Five).That said, the DISC framework can still be a helpful introduction for those looking to learn more about \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00 and how to interact effectively with others.When I first encountered DISC in 2016, I spent some time compiling all the information I could find on the different traits into \ud835\uddee \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01.\ud83d\udc49 I found it helpful at the time, so \ud835\udddc'\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02.

I couldn\u2019t articulate it very well, so I looked it up. Growing and thriving are similar in that they both refer to the development of new abilities, the expansion of existing ones or some form of progress. However:A growing plant is getting bigger and developing new leaves and branches. Likewise, a \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb is developing new skills and experiences that help them become more capable and knowledgeable.Instead, a thriving plant is not just getting bigger but is also healthy and producing flowers or fruit.

Thriving, on the other hand, implies that something is not just growing but is also healthy and prosperous. As we consider the future of our career, company, or family, it is helpful to ask ourselves whether we are simply growing or if we are truly thriving. \ud83e\udde9", "content_media": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEeXLkHoOpDCg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1670419208722?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=sHzRUEbzBpQynY2Vukg41mculpwOvTkPSXArBGwX3Ng", "date": "December-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7006245996439502849"}, {"content_of_the_post": "We have heard that AI will change everything, but most of us don't have access to any practical tool we could use daily. \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf8.Open AI launched ChatGPT, a game-changing natural language processing tool that generates responses to user inputs.

Or no one might have a clear responsibility for seeing that the project benefits are realized.

After some discussions, we identified five key milestones, each with 8-12 tasks, for a total of over 60 deliverables.Now 60 deliverables might seem daunting, but whether we document them or not, we are still accountable for delivering them. So why not list them all?If you are in a Strategy and Planning role it probably means you are not accountable for project delivery, so creating a checklist is not your responsibility.But in my experience, it was helpful to ask my delivery partners to create one and share it with me so I could better understand the amount of effort involved and how things were progressing.\ud83e\udde9Click [+ Follow] for more  #BusinessValueScore #Framework", "content_media": null, "date": "September-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6975789029539618816"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to prioritize your company's SaaS projects - \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29 4.1 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c' \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud83d\udc47Tracking a project's status throughout the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) sounds obvious, but it can be tricky when discussing a SaaS project with multiple Agile releases over several months.That's because different Work Packages can be in flight simultaneously but in various stages of the SDLC. So it becomes difficult to understand and communicate the status of the overall project succinctly.One approach is to track each single work package independently. In this case, it's easier to communicate status quickly (e.g. Red, Green or Yellow), but we lose the holistic view of the project.My approach was to visualize the status of each of the various stages of the software delivery lifecycle. Like in the example in the screenshot.

How we make decisions on the SteerCo is critical to its success and efficacy. And the decision-making approach is very much influenced by the company culture. In our case, decisions were made mainly by consensus, which can be time-consuming when compared, for example, to a voting system of some sort. I found that stating precisely what decision we needed to make at the beginning of the SteerCo helped frame the discussion and reduced (although not eliminated) the chance of ending the meeting with no clear decision. If I had to do it again, I would consider having a smaller group of participants on the SteerCo. And I would be more deliberate about including the right senior leadership level (e.g. Directors vs VPs) depending on the decision. \ud83e\udde9Click [+ Follow] for more  #BusinessValueScore #Framework", "content_media": null, "date": "August-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6970149660237725696"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to prioritize your company\u2019s SaaS projects - \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29 3.1B \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\u2018\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud83d\udc47Yesterday I discussed the pitfalls of running a SteerCo meeting. Today I\u2019m starting to share the lessons I learned. Running effective and successful SteerCo Meetings is a valuable skill and deserves its series of posts.There are hundreds of articles about SteerCo's best practices, and I\u2019m sure there are books about it. I haven\u2019t read them. But here is what I\u2019ve understood from direct experience:  \u2022 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 #1 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e-\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2cLarge projects are complex; they require lots of change management, starting from the top. I found that reviewing with the Directors the content of the meeting agenda and stating my goals and recommendations in advance drove better outcomes. So why not just do it all the time? Because things move fast and time available in calendars is limited. So it wasn\u2019t always possible to prep. Or not with everyone. If I had to do it again, I would hire 1 or 2 Senior Program Managers to help me with Directors SteerCo Meetings prep and management. \ud83e\udde9Click [+ Follow] for more  #BusinessValueScore #Framework", "content_media": null, "date": "August-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6969628438919860224"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to prioritize your company\u2019s SaaS projects - \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29 3.1A \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2c\ud83d\udc47Running effective and successful SteerCo Meetings is quite tricky.

Our Director SteerCo got good attendance in the first few months, but after a while, someone started sending their delegates. This created a vicious circle where eventually, there would only be delegates on the call, which meant the SteerCo had lost its purpose. \u2022 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d. Keeping the audience engaged starts with creating relevant and engaging content for everyone. This can be challenging when some of the projects are not important or not top of mind to some participants. \u2022 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c. One of the purposes of a SteerCo is to make decisions. Enabling Directors to make decisions starts with conveying complex information succinctly.Communicating effectively to a diverse audience with different levels of familiarity with each project can be a difficult balance to strike. \ud83d\udc49 Tomorrow I\u2019ll share some lessons I\u2019ve learned (the hard way) about managing SteerCos. \ud83e\udde9Click [+ Follow] for more  #BusinessValueScore #Framework", "content_media": null, "date": "August-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6969266031278129152"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to prioritize your company\u2019s SaaS projects - \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29 3.1 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2c\ud83d\udc47The Steering Committee, or SteerCo, is an advisory body, often part of project governance. When managing the project funnel, we grouped the initiatives into three main groups: small, medium and large. Small and medium-sized initiatives didn\u2019t need a SteerCo. We determined their priority almost exclusively based on the Business Value Score (BVS) calculated in step 2.2. For large initiatives, the BVS was just a way to identify which projects we should bring in front of the SteerCo for discussion. Once the project was on the SteerCo shortlist, the BVS didn\u2019t matter much anymore, other than providing more context around costs and effort estimation if required. The SteerCo Meeting was an opportunity for the leadership of the different Business groups to get a holistic view of all the projects and discuss their relative priority.  \ud83e\udde9Click [+ Follow] for more  #BusinessValueScore #Framework", "content_media": null, "date": "August-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6968903645010554880"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to prioritize your company\u2019s SaaS projects - \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29 3.0 \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud83d\udc47Sizing the projects and ranking them was an essential step in our selection process, but not the final one. In my experience, the Business teams might not be aware of each other's initiatives, and the team managing the project funnel might be the only one with a holistic view of what\u2019s happening in the organization. So, we had to raise awareness by bringing this holistic view back to the different business groups, especially when discussing the most transformational initiatives. For the organization to make an informed decision, it was essential that we established the proper forums and communicated a lot of information quickly and effectively. Governance is the most critical of the steps and the most difficult to get right.

It does make sense to prioritize the projects with the most robust business case. \u26a0\ufe0f In my experience, though, there is one crucial caveat:Building a business case that includes ROI and IRR calculations takes time, skills and effort. And the problem with that is not all the business units in the company have strategy managers or performance analysts on staff to build one. The result is that some business units won\u2019t submit a project not because it wouldn\u2019t drive lot of value but simply because they don\u2019t have the staff to create a compelling business case.

DCUT estimation comprises only those three aspects of software development, and it does NOT consider any supporting activity, such as project management, quality assurance, environment management and other shared services.

SDLC is what the stakeholders generally think it\u2019s being estimated. And the difference can be pretty staggering. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if DCUT represented only 50% or even 40% of the overall SDLC effort. This discrepancy can obviously have a significant impact on the accuracy of cost estimates.

A few considerations when selecting the fields and questions to include in the form:- To avoid the proliferation of \u201cnice to know\u201d questions, we ask only for info that is critical to making an assessment - Where possible, we present a list of predefined options, like drop-down, radio boxes or multiple choice options- We provide the submitter with the opportunity to provide business context via free text fields and attachments (e.g. screenshots etc.) \ud83d\udc49 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c are conditions for submitting the form and engaging the resources required to make the cost assessment (e.g. technical architects etc.) A few considerations about engagement rules:- Depending on the situation, we might want to allow every user of our tool or platform to submit a new request. - In other cases, we might want only a representative or business prime for each stakeholders\u2019 group to submit a new project. - Overall, we are trying to strike a balance. We don\u2019t want to put up too many barriers to project submission.

Your practice could become stale, irrelevant and ineffective over time - unable to see new paradigms and take advantage of new opportunities.

In practical terms, that means clearing your calendar for a few weeks. My target is to hire based on a ~80 minutes time commitment from the candidate over two to three weeks. That is a 5-10 mins behavioural survey, 15 mins phone interview, and 60 mins panel interview.I'd bet that's faster than the vast majority of hiring managers without a structured approach. \ud83e\udde9~~~PS: Get the free guide at  www [dot] EffectiveHiring [dot] guide ", "content_media": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQEAgkw0K5fxAQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1647605704677?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=652QY9YqnJ82pes83zH6v8C2MvAUiFWGReykQ2u1ACk", "date": "May-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6910559231108636672"}, {"content_of_the_post": "How to make the most of the Effective Hiring guide:\u2192 If you are not hiring now, this is the perfect time to write a one-page job description (step 1.1).Contact 3-5 people familiar with the roles you'll be hiring for and ask them to answer the five questions.And spend time exploring the options you have available at your firm in terms of behavioural assessment tools.\u2192 Instead, if you are actively hiring, the most significant value resides in getting steps 4.2 (behavioural questions) and step 4.5 (debrief with the panel) right.

This. Is. Important. Don't start the debrief until everyone has provided their recommendation.During the debrief session, every panel member presents their rationale and evaluation on the three main criteria identified in step #4.1: Interpersonal, Culture fit, and Skills.You can use the Candidate Tracking tool from step #2.1 to record the recommendations of each panel member.Ultimately the decision sits with the hiring manager. However, in my experience, the recommendation from the panel is often unanimous, in one direction or the other. Occasionally a panel member has a different opinion from the majority, which we can discuss during the debriefing. If the panel is split between Hire / No Hire, I suggest proceeding with extreme caution.

Tell me about a time when you made a decision that wasn't popular, and explain how you implemented it successfully.They follow this format: the Context (right decisions are unpopular), the Invitation (Tell me), and the Desired Behaviour (how you implemented it successfully). There are hundreds of questions online to get you inspired. You can use this format to create 10-12 questions. While some questions can apply to any role, I'd offer that the best ones are targeting specific behaviours required by the position, which you have identified in the Job Description and the Behavioural Target (steps 1.1 and 1.2).\ud83e\udde9", "content_media": null, "date": "May-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6901877015851388928"}, {"content_of_the_post": "#FabiosHiringGuide, Step 4.1 - Purpose and structure of the panel interviewI think it's important to clarify the purpose of the panel interview because I used to believe that the goal was to hire a candidate...Instead, the actual goal is to identify all candidates who meet our standards.

Here's how to find out in a few minutes.Understanding and communicating your team capacity/availability is top of mind if you are involved with project delivery. So last year I created this spreadsheet to estimate my team's capacity. While not perfect, it proved pretty helpful in forecasting the ebbs and flows of our bandwidth.My team is moving to an online project management tool, and I thought I'd share the 2022 version of the file for those that might need it.This file is not supposed to be perfectly accurate. Instead, it provides a weekly forecast of available capacity *at a glance*. I prioritized ease of use over accuracy because I think the margin of error in these estimates is pretty high anyway. I'll include a link in the comments if you want to give it a try for your team. To start using the file, you will need to copy the original. Go on to the top left, click File > Make a copyHere's a quick overview of how it works:- Row 1 shows the weekly schedule for the year. The current week automatically shows in yellow, so you can easily identify it. The Q1 weeks are coloured in gray, Q2 in blue etc.- Row 3 shows the average team allocation. It estimates the overall capacity of your team for each given week. It simply calculates the average of all the team members' allocation in the spreadsheet. - Row 5 shows the individual team member allocation based on the different projects they support. For example, there are 15 team members in the file with up to 10 projects each (not shown in the screenshot).- When you enter your team member's name in cell A5, it will automatically populate in the rows below. How I use it:- I ask my team to enter their own estimated allocation at the beginning of each week. They enter the % allocation in the relevant cells for the entire project duration if possible. If not, I ask for a five weeks forecast.- These numbers can change from week to week, so I don't use them as commitments but rather as best guesses. Again, I'm prioritizing timeliness over accuracy.- I briefly review the estimates every one or two weeks during the recurring 1:1s to better understand the status- For example, looking at the forecast in the screenshot, you can tell that this team member will have a peak of work at the end of February and that they will likely be available to support another significant project only as of the week of March 14 (when their estimated time allocation drops to 60%).That's it in a nutshell. I hope it can be helpful. If you have less than 15 direct reports, you'll need to change the formula on Row 3 to calculate the average correctly. Add a comment below if you need some help to do that. If any of you spreadsheet gurus have ideas on improving it or automating it more, please go ahead and share the love.", "content_media": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQFRAiitqf1otw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1641911247064?e=1686787200&v=beta&t=Wqb7ZwOg6gbFPB0RccDR3s4f_4tmxNg-UYZXzrlyTJQ", "date": "May-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6886674942931345410"}, {"content_of_the_post": "Have you ever heard of Self-Determination theory? The term self-determination refers to a person's own ability to manage themselves, make confident choices, and think on their own.

I recently had the chance to talk about my team's engagement, and I referred to this theory as one of my guiding principles in managing people since I learned about it several years ago.\u2022 AutonomyIt is about leveraging individual talents, avoiding micromanagement and getting out of the way. It also means being tolerant of mistakes and allowing people the time to fix their errors: individuals who are not terrified of making mistakes will accelerate their learning curve. \u2022 CompetenceIt is about providing clear guidelines about the expected deliverables and then upskilling for any gaps. A clear path to career progression is also an element of developing competence: this can be achieved by clearly identifying the skills and level of proficiency required to achieve the following role/title.\u2022 BelongingIt is about fostering a team culture of business performance and lightheartedness. I've read somewhere that camaraderie results from sharing pain (i.e. hard work and failures) and laughter. I've found that to be true.

Volume of Work.\u2022 In the other columns, write the team members' names. Then for each performance dimension, assign a value. I use a 5-point Likert scale, from Very High to Very Low. Although I do have a good sense of each individual's performance, I find this step helps articulate what I already know more precisely.\u2022 Next step is to write the review. I generally write a Core Message first, which is the one thing I want the team member to remember. Then I elaborate with more comments following the SEER format (Summarize, Elaborate, Example, Restate), for example, Amy is my best strategy manager. She consistently exceeds every standard. She recently got approval for a project we struggled with for months. She's an example we should put on training videos.\u2022 To help me with the exact language, I've used a few books like Phrases for effective performance reviews when drafting the message. Those sentences are great templates that I can refine to communicate what I want to convey more effectively and professionally.Again, this summary barely scratches the surface of this critical and timely topic.

That's because the number of relationships amongst team members increases geometrically. Basically, in any group of n people (like your team), the number of possible relationships (R) is [ n x (n-1) / 2 ]. This phenomenon is one of the main reasons it's so tricky to manage tremendous growth.  More people means more communication issues, more outcomes to manage, and more incentives to consider. I've seen it first hand three times in my career when the group I was part of grew rapidly. And in my experience, it's easy to underestimate the rate at which complexity increases as the team expands. Outside the business world, think about the birth of a third child. When the family goes from 4 to 5 members, relationships almost double from 6 to 10.  Agile's ideal team size is famously set based on the two-pizza rule, which states that no squad should be so large that two pizzas can't feed the whole group. That's about eight people or 28 relationships.

Yet, I found it difficult to explain it quickly. Then I found this video. Tom Bilyeu explained to Quentin Tarantino how to use non-fungible tokens with his cult movie Pulp Fiction. Watch it to learn what's an NFT in 60 seconds.So NFTs are about:\u2022 Ownership: the same way an original Picasso is worth more than a copy. Blockchain technology allows for tracking of the lineage and guarantees originality.\u2022 Status: the same way people buy luxury brands like Gucci or Ferrari, to communicate Status. A public wallet of the NFTs owned will allow communicating Status at a distance and to a larger audience.\u2022 Belonging: communities develop around artists, fictional characters, games, and more. NFTs will allow people to identify each other and join large or exclusive groups and events. \u2022 Value Storage: imagine if the Beatles released 500 NFTs of their debut song's artwork (Love Me Do, 1962), let's say to raise funds amongst their early fans. How much do you think that would be worth today?There are inflated expectations around this technology today. As a result, not all current NFT projects will be successful.

Was it a success story?\u201cHire for attitude, train for skills\u201d has become a pretty ubiquitous saying. It sounds great, I like it a lot. And I implement it with moderation. Hiring a team exclusively based on attitude (assuming you can accurately assess it) won\u2019t generally allow you to deliver results fast enough. You need people who have been in the trenches, can hit the ground running and can teach the ropes to the rest of the team. On the other side, hiring exclusively based on skill will likely not generate enough innovation in the long term. Your practice could become stale, irrelevant and ineffective over time - unable to see new paradigms and take advantage of new opportunities. It has been my experience and it is my belief that if you want to build a resilient team, you need to build a diverse bench, with both highly skilled seasoned professionals as well as people with less domain expertise but with lot of potential (i.e. they are a good culture fit, demonstrate a strong work ethic, have a growth-mindset and are coachable). The ideal composition would depend on complexity of the skills to be acquired, on the need for early results, and on team size, among other factors - but I\u2019d say a good rule of thumb for the team ratio is 2/3 skilled professionals and 1/3 people with potential.

You can follow all the right steps, and still make a bad hire (type 1 error). Or miss the opportunity to hire a superstar (type 2 error), because the system screened them out \u2013 or maybe because the process took too long and they accepted another offer. So, make a bad hire or miss a superstar: which one of the two is the biggest error?The benefits of a great hire are so disproportionate that missing the opportunity to hire a superstar is likely the worst of the two. As you can never get that back. You can\u2019t really fix that mistake. On the other side, you can fix a bad hire. And the faster you act, the more contained is the damage.

Magazine article.\u00a0The one sentence I do agree with is that the value people bring \u201care their ideas. Their creativity. Their analysis. Their willingness to take responsibility\u00a0and embrace accountability\u201d. For the rest, this is terrible advice, particularly for people who are starting in a new role, a new team or a new company.\u00a0To begin with, verbal communication famously represents less than half of all communication between individuals. So for a remote workforce desperately looking to cooperate and to bridge distances, cutting off the massive value of non-verbal communication seems unwise.\u00a0Furthermore, I don't agree with the hidden assumption that you need to perform for the camera. Why can't you just be yourself? Many things once taboo while videoconferencing, are now common and acceptable (e.g. kids sneaking behind their on-camera parents). It\u2019s actually been an incredible tool for sharing our own uniqueness and getting closer to each other.\u00a0Lastly, one of the points of the article is that people \u201cused to look at you less during in-person meetings\u201d compared to how much they look at you now during online meetings. This seems ludicrous. People did look at you all the time during an in person meeting.\u00a0I consider myself an introvert, and I understand the appeal of being off-camera. Yet a while ago I made the decision that it was important to keep my camera on at all times, for all meetings. I figured that as we lost the opportunity to connect in person, it was important (1) for my team, my peers and my boss to see me on daily basis and (2) for people that didn\u2019t know me yet, to realize I wasn\u2019t just a faceless voice.\u00a0When someone joins my team, one of the first things I tell them during our first meeting on their first day, is that in order to be successful they will need to build relationships. In fact, it is part of being on the team and one of the reasons I hired them for. It\u2019s literally a paragraph in the recruitment ad. They are expected to develop relationships with our team, partners and stakeholders. And turning on the webcam is the simplest, most powerful step they can take towards that goal.\u00a0I invite my team members to keep their camera on during their own meetings because I honestly believe that it\u2019ll help their relationships \u2013 and careers \u2013 in the long term. I do request them to be on camera during our weekly 1:1s and all-team meetings as it helps me read the room, pick up on non-verbal clues and get a sense of whether my message is landing correctly \u2013 all things that I can no longer do in person. I do this because any tiny piece of feedback I can get, helps me generate better outcomes for all. \u00a0Turning on the camera is the simplest yet most powerful gesture for a remote workforce to build stronger relationships, connect more deeply with each other and be more successful in their role.#RemoteWorkforce #Career #Meetings #Opinions", "content_media": null, "date": "May-2022", "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6858760709694742528"}, {"content_of_the_post": "Great session with my team today about mapping all the steps and deliverables required for the successful completion of User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
